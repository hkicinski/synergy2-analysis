# E009-hk-Homology_Synergy 

## Orthology analysis of yeast species using Synergy2

This project aims to identify and analyze orthology relationships among cell cycle genes across four yeast species: 
-_S. cerevisiae_ 
-_C. glabrata_
-_C. albicans_
-_K. lactis_

The analysis focuses on characterizing the homology of these cell cycle genes at the resolution that distinguishes orthogroup assignment via paralogy, orthology, and even ohnology. By using the SYNERGY2 algorithm, the goal will be to accomplish this characterization task algorithmically.
