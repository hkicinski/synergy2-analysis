BLASTp Analysis Summary:
Total sequences in root.pep: 16818
Total C. glabrata reference proteins: 5280
root.pep sequences with C. glabrata matches (≥50.0% identity, ≥50.0% coverage): 3887 (23.1%)
C. glabrata proteins with root.pep matches (≥50.0% identity, ≥50.0% coverage): 3780 (71.6%)
Reciprocal best hits: 4756 (90.1%)
High quality matches (≥90% identity, ≥90% coverage): 560 (3.3%)

Interpretation:
✓ TRANSLATION QUALITY IS GOOD: Most C. glabrata proteins have high-quality matches in root.pep
  The orthology discrepancies are likely due to algorithmic differences between SYNERGY2 and YGOB/CGOB,
  not translation issues.
